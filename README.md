# How to run

- [x] Clone the repository using either `git clone` on the terminal or download and extract the zip file.
- [x] Open up the cloned folder in your preferred text editor. Open up a terminal within your workspace and navigate into the RESTful-API folder 
- [x] Within that folder, run `npm install` which will install all dependencies for you after which you can run `npm start` and you should get the default react-app running on http://localhost:3000 as shown :point_down:
